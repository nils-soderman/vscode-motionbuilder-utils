# MotionBuilder (VSCode Extention)

<b>
Please Note: This extention is currently in early development!
</b>

<br>

Improvements for writing code/scripts for MotionBuilder.



## Features

### Run code in MotionBuilder directly from the editor

You no longer need to leave the editor to execute code inside of MotionBuilder.
Now VSCode can act just like MotionBuilder's Python Editor.


### Auto-Completion

This extention automatically sets up Python auto-completion for the MotionBuilder sdk.



### Browse the Documentation

Quickly search through the documentation from within the editor, and open the page in a new web-browser tab.
