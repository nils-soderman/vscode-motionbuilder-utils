# MotionBuilder Utils (VSCode)

Editor features to assist when writing Python code for Autodesk MotionBuilder.

# Features

## Run code in MotionBuilder directly from the editor

You no longer need to leave the editor to execute code inside of MotionBuilder.
Now VSCode can act just like MotionBuilder's Python Editor.

Command: `MotionBuilder: Execute` <br>
Keyboard Shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>

The selected text will be executed, if nothing is selected the entire document will be executed.
