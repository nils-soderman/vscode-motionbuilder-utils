# MotionBuilder Utils (VSCode Extention)

<b>
Please Note: This extention is currently in early development!
</b>

<br>

Editor features to assist when writing Python code for Autodesk MotionBuilder.

---

## Features

<br>

### Run code in MotionBuilder directly from the editor

You no longer need to leave the editor to execute code inside of MotionBuilder.
Now VSCode can act just like MotionBuilder's Python Editor.

With the command: `MotionBuilder: Execute` <br> or using the Hotkey (default mapping: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>).

The selected text will be executed in MotionBuilder & the output will be printed in VSCode.

If nothing is selected when running the command the entire document will be executed.

<br>

### Auto-Completion

This extention automatically sets up Python auto-completion for the MotionBuilder sdk.

This assumes PyLance is installed as it'll add an additional path to `python.analysis.extraPaths`

<br>

### Browse the Documentation

Quickly search through the documentation from within the editor, and open the page in a new web-browser tab.

Command: `MotionBuilder: Browse Documentation`

Default hotkey mapping to browse the python docs: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F1</kbd>
